# OpenCL Neural Network Library

I wanted to learn how OpenCL and stuff worked so what better way to do that than to create some NN library!

To compile:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

The above will allow you to run `./openCLNN` which has a basic example for now

## To Do

- Backwards pass
- Activation functions
- Convolutions
- Pooling (Max, Mean, etc.)
- Backwards pass for convolutions
- Backwards pass for pooling
